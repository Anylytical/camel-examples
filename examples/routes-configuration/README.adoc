== Camel Example Routes Configuration

This example shows how Camel is capable of loading routes during startup using the new route loader system.
The route loader has support for loading routes in XML, Java and YAML (other languages to be added).

In this example the focus is on how you can use global _routes configuration_ with the DSL to seperate
error handling (and other cross routes functionality) from all your routes.


=== How to run

You can run this example using

----
$ mvn camel:run
